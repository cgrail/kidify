Spotify for Kids

I've written this app for my kids to be able to control what they're listening to. The restriction is done by simply creating playlists. Your kid will only be allowed to listen to playlists which you have created for your child. My kid for example is just able to listen to audiobooks which I think are appropiate for his age.
